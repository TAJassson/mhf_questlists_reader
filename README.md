mhf_questlists_reader is a c# form that allows you to read questlist files.  
Not 100% functional, but you can still use it.  
Also it may help you to understand questlist and quest file, becasue both have similar structure.
I'm planning to add an function that add new quest to questlist easily, but I can't promise that.
