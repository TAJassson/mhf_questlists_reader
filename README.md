mhf_questlists_reader is a c# form that allows you to manage questlist files.  

I'm sorry for so much bugs.

# Todo
- Load more values such as Equipments, skills, limitation etc.

# Before you use
Below are some important tips for using this repo. Please read them at least once.  
- My reader may not read publicly shared questlist files correctly because it does not have proper structure. Also I don't recommend you to keep using it as it is because the reader doesn't support it for a technical reason. Here's how to fix it.   
Open `list_168.bin` with binary editor(eg.HxD) and check offset 01h. It's a number of quests this file loads. If it is `13`, change it to `0D`, becasue `list_168.bin` has 13 quests in total and it should be described as `0D` in hex but somehow the value is `13` of integers.

- Before you add new quest, deleting these quests is highly recommended from `list_168.bin`.

- You should decrypt quest file itself with a tool called `ReFrontier` before you use `Add` button.
- Each questlist files are able to contain up to 42 quests.
- While you can add new quest to list, you cannot add new list file via editor. Thus, I recommend you not to delete all quests from one of list files. I mean leave at least one quest in list.  
- `Export` button creates new questlist files, and overwrites if there is one there with the same name files.  
- `Save change` button is used to save current selected quest changes.  

# Known issues
- Sometimes `Delete` button doesn't work correctly.

# Build
Don't forget to drop `Stored_Data` folder to the same path where exe created.
